### **Chapter 2 Product Development from a Textile Perspective**


I. Product Development: the design and engineering of a product so that it has the desired
serviceability characteristics, appeals to the target market, can be made within an acceptable
time frame for a reasonable cost, and sold at a profit.
A. Helps determine product image, performance, appearance, and cost
B. Color and trend forecasting
C. Fabric presentation and information
D. Encompasses range of activities
E. Requires understanding of customers and consumers (target market)
F. Innovation
G. Product management
H. Understanding of textiles
I. Confinement: only one firm uses a color, pattern, or fabric
J. Assortment: a group of fabrics that share a commonality of design, structure, or color
II. Serviceability and the Consumer
A. Serviceability: the measure of a textile product’s ability to meet consumers’ needs.
1. Aesthetics: attractiveness or appearance of a textile product.
2. 2. Durability: how the product withstands use; the length of time the product is
   3. considered suitable for the use for which it was purchased.
   4. 3. Comfort & safety: how a textile product affects heat, air, and moisture transfer, the
      4. way the body and textile product interact, and its ability to protect the body from harm.
      5. 4. Appearance retention: how product maintains its appearance during use and care.
         5. 5. Care; treatment required to maintain a textile product’s original appearance.
            6. 6. Environmental concerns: effect on the environment of the production, use, care, and
               7. disposal of textiles and textile products.
               8. 7. Sustainability: describes practices and policies that reduce environmental pollution and
                  8. do not exploit people or natural resources in meeting the lifestyle needs of the present
                  9. without compromising the future.
                  10. 8. Lifecycle impact: examines the way the production, use, care, and disposal of a

                      10. 9. Cost: influenced by many factors, including price or amount paid to acquire, use,
                          10. maintain, and dispose of a product.
                          11. III. Performance: the manner in which a textile, textile component, or textile product responds
                          12. when something is done to it or when it is exposed to some element in the environment that
                          13. might adversely affect the textile.
                          14. A. Determined by the component within a textile product.
                          15. B. Fabric performance may be assessed by the fabric producer, the firm buying the fabric, or
                          16. an outside firm that specializes in assessing fabric performance.
                          17. C. Fabric performance analysis is voluntary, except for flammability of some products.

                          20. F. Product quality may refer to the sum total of product characteristics such as appearance
                          21. appropriateness for end use, performance of materials, consistency among identical
                          22. products, and freedom from defects in construction or materials.
                          23. IV. Information Sources
